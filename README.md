# welcome-
Just my first learning task
I want to learn Github for my future job
How long it might take to learn Github: May be by today I will learn the basics of Git hub. I will learn uploading all my project files in the future for sure.

What are the projects you have done already?

Build a static chess board game.
Build a website for a food truck.
Build my personal website potraying my resume in it.
Build a drum kit game using Javascript and Jquery.
Most of my projects are mostly concentrated on front end.
